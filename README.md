## 🎬 Introduction

OpenCapCut is an ambitious open-source project aiming to revolutionize **AI video editing** by integrating advanced **generative AI** capabilities. Inspired by the ease of use of CapCut and the innovative AI features seen in tools like Descript, Magic Hour, Argil, Focal, Runway Gen-3/Gen-4, and HeyGen Agents, our goal is to create a powerful, flexible, and accessible **agentic video editor** for all content creators and video producers.

This project is currently in its very early stages, focusing on building a robust foundation, a clean user interface, and fundamental video manipulation capabilities. As we evolve, we will incrementally add sophisticated **AI-driven features**.

## 🚀 Current Features

As of now, OpenCapCut provides a basic foundation for **AI video editing**, including:

*   **Video Upload:** 📤 Users can easily select and upload local video files for editing.
*   **Video Playback:** ▶️ The uploaded video can be played back seamlessly within the application.

## 💡 Future Vision & Planned Features

We envision OpenCapCut as a collaborative platform where creators, developers, and **AI enthusiasts** can contribute to building the next generation of **agentic video editing tools**. Our long-term goals and planned **AI features** for enhanced **video production** include:

*   **Intuitive Editing:** ✂️ A user-friendly interface reminiscent of CapCut for effortless editing.

*   **Transcript-based Editing:** 📝 Edit video by editing text, similar to Descript's innovative approach.

*   **AI-Powered Visual Effects:** ✨ Smart scene analysis, object removal, style transfer, and **generative AI** effects akin to Magic Hour, Argil, and Focal.

*   **Generative Video:** 🎥 Capabilities similar to Runway Gen-3/Gen-4 for creating new **video content** from text descriptions or images.

*   **Agentic AI Integration:** 🤖 Tools for **AI avatars**, dynamic voiceovers, and **generative content creation**, inspired by HeyGen Agents.

## 🧠 Why "Agentic"?

The "Agentic" in OpenCapCut signifies our commitment to integrating intelligent, autonomous **AI agents** directly into the **video editing workflow**. These agents will:

*   **Automate Tedious Tasks:** ⏱️ Handle repetitive actions like cutting silences, generating captions, or **AI color grading**.

*   **Suggest Creative Enhancements:** 🎨 Provide intelligent recommendations for transitions, music, or visual styles for your **video projects**.

*   **Enable Generative Workflows:** ✍️ Allow users to describe desired video segments or effects, and have **AI agents** generate them.

*   **Personalize Content:** 🎯 Adapt editing styles and recommendations based on user preferences and project goals for tailored **video production**.
