## Introduction

OpenCapCut is an ambitious open-source project aiming to revolutionize video editing by integrating advanced AI capabilities. Inspired by the ease of use of CapCut and the innovative AI features seen in tools like Descript, Magic Hour, Argil, Focal, Runway Gen-3/Gen-4, and HeyGen Agents, our goal is to create a powerful, flexible, and accessible video editor for everyone.

This project is currently in its very early stages. The initial focus is on building a robust foundation, a clean user interface, and integrating fundamental video manipulation capabilities. As we evolve, we will incrementally add sophisticated AI-driven features.

## Current Features

As of now, OpenCapCut provides a basic foundation for video editing, including:

*   **Video Upload:** Users can select and upload local video files.
*   **Video Playback:** The uploaded video can be played back within the application.

## Future Vision & Planned Features

We envision OpenCapCut as a collaborative platform where creators, developers, and AI enthusiasts can contribute to building the next generation of video editing tools. Our long-term goals and planned features include:

*   **Intuitive Editing:** A user-friendly interface reminiscent of CapCut.
*   **Transcript-based Editing:** Edit video by editing text, like Descript.
*   **AI-Powered Visual Effects:** Smart scene analysis, object removal, style transfer, and generative effects akin to Magic Hour, Argil, and Focal.
*   **Generative Video:** Capabilities similar to Runway Gen-3/Gen-4 for creating new video content from text or images.
*   **Agentic AI Integration:** Tools for AI avatars, voiceovers, and dynamic content generation, inspired by HeyGen Agents.

## Why "Agentic"?

The "Agentic" in OpenCapCut signifies our commitment to integrating intelligent, autonomous AI agents directly into the editing workflow. These agents will:

*   **Automate Tedious Tasks:** Handle repetitive actions like cutting silences, generating captions, or color grading.
*   **Suggest Creative Enhancements:** Provide intelligent recommendations for transitions, music, or visual styles.
*   **Enable Generative Workflows:** Allow users to describe desired video segments or effects, and have an AI agent generate them.
*   **Personalize Content:** Adapt editing styles and recommendations based on user preferences and project goals.
